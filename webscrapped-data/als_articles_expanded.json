Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), formerly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a neurological disorder that affects motor neurons. Motor neurons are the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord that control voluntary muscle movement and breathing. As motor neurons degenerate and die, they stop sending messages to the muscles. This causes the muscles to weaken, start to twitch (fasciculations), and waste away (atrophy). Eventually, in people with ALS, the brain loses its ability to start and control voluntary movements such as walking, talking, chewing and other functions, as well as breathing. ALS is progressive, meaning symptoms get worse over time. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved several drugs for ALS that may prolong survival, reduce the rate of decline, or help manage symptoms. But there\u2019s currently no known treatment that stops or reverses the progression of ALS. Early symptoms include: As the disorder progresses, muscle weakness and atrophy spread to other parts of the body. People with ALS may develop problems with: Eventually, people with ALS become unable to stand or walk, get in or out of bed on their own, use their hands and arms, or breathe on their own. Because they usually remain able to reason, remember, and understand, they are aware of their progressive loss of function. This can cause anxiety and depression in the person with ALS and their loved ones. Although not as common, people with ALS also may experience problems with language or decision-making. Some also developa form of dementia known as FTD-ALS. Most people with ALS die from being unable to breathe on their own (known as respiratory failure), usually within three to five years of symptoms first appearing. But about 1 in 10 people survive for 10 years or more. A risk factor is a condition or behavior, like high blood pressure or smoking, that increases the likelihood of having a certain health problem compared to those who don't have the risk factor. Having a risk factor doesn't mean a person will develop ALS, and not having a risk factor doesn't mean they won\u2019t. Risk factors for ALS include: Some studies suggest military veterans are about one and a half to two times more likely to develop ALS, although the reason for this is unclear. Possible risk factors for veterans include exposure to lead, pesticides, and other environmental toxins. Some studies have also shown that head injury can be associated with higher risk for ALS, but more research is needed to understand this connection. Nearly all cases of ALS are considered sporadic, meaning the disorder seems to happen at random with no clearly associated risk factors and no family history. Although family members of people with ALS are at an increased risk for the disorder the overall risk is very low\u2014most won\u2019t develop ALS. About 10% of all ALS cases are familial (also called inherited or genetic). Mutations (changes) in more than a dozen genes have been found to cause familial ALS. For example: In 2021, a team of scientists led by the National Institutes of Health and the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences announced it had discovereda unique form of genetic ALS that affects children as young as 4 years. This childhood form is linked to the gene SPTLC1 that is part of the body's fat production system and may be caused by changes in the way the body uses fatty materials (lipids). It\u2019s important to get an accurate ALS diagnosis as soon as possible. ALS treatments may be most effective soon after symptoms start. A neurologist familiar with ALS can help a person get diagnosed early. There is no single test that can definitely diagnose ALS. A doctor will conduct a physical exam and review the person\u2019s full medical history. A neurologic examination will test reflexes, muscle strength, and other responses. These tests should be performed at regular intervals to assess whether symptoms are getting worse over time. A doctor may conduct muscle and imaging tests to rule out other disorders. This can help support an ALS diagnosis. One test is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce detailed images of the brain and spinal cord. Another is electromyography (EMG), which evaluates how well nerves and muscles are functioning. An EMG can include: Other tests can rule out the possibility of other disorders. They can include: Find out more about neurological diagnostic tests and procedures. There\u2019s no treatment to reverse damage to motor neurons or cure ALS at this time. But some treatments may slow progression of the disorder, improve quality of life, and extend survival. New treatments have become available in the past several years, and researchers continue to explore different options to slow or stop progression of ALS. Integrated, multi-disciplinary teams of professionals are best prepared to provide supportive health care. These teams can design an individualized treatment plan and provide special equipment aimed at keeping people as mobile, comfortable, and independent as possible. They may include: Doctors may use the following medicines approved by the FDA to support a treatment plan for ALS: Sodium phenylbutyrate/taurursodiol (Relyvrio) is an oral medicine that was proposed to prevent nerve cell death by blocking stress signals in cells. The FDA approved Relyvrio based on safety and efficacy data from a single, smaller ALS clinical trial in September 2022. But a larger clinical trial failed to confirm the earlier findings, and the manufacturer of Relyvrio removed the drug from the market in 2024. A doctor may prescribe other medicines or treatments to help manage symptoms\u2014including muscle cramps and stiffness, excessive saliva and phlegm, and unwanted episodes of crying, laughing, or other emotional displays. Medicines may also help with any pain, depression, sleep problems, or constipation. A treatment plan for ALS usually includes rehabilitation, which should be tailored to the person\u2019s individual needs. It may include physical, occupational, and speech therapy. Physical therapy can help people with ALS maintain function and movement. This includes lowering their risk of falls and joint pain and maximizing their independence at different stages of the disorder. Low-impact exercises such as walking, swimming, or using a stationary exercise bike\u2014along with range of motion exercises\u2014can help maintain muscle strength and function. Occupational therapists can help with daily living and self-care activities. They can also suggest assistive devices for feeding, bathing, and grooming so that the person can be as independent as possible. Speech therapists can help people with ALS learn strategies to speak louder and more clearly\u2014and help maintain the ability to communicate. Computer-based speech synthesizers use eye-tracking devices that allow a person to use the internet and to type on custom screens to communicate. People with ALS sometimes use voice banking, a process that stores their own voice for future use in computer-based speech synthesizers. A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a system that allows people to communicate or control equipment such as a wheelchair using only brain activity. Researchers are developing more efficient, mobile BCIs for people with severe paralysis or visual impairments. People with ALS may have trouble chewing and swallowing their food, and getting the nutrients they need. Nutritionists and registered dieticians can help plan small, nutritious meals throughout the day\u2014and identify foods to avoid. When the person can no longer eat with help, a feeding tube can reduce the person\u2019s risk of choking and pneumonia. As the muscles responsible for breathing start to weaken, people with ALS may have shortness of breath during physical activity and difficulty breathing at night or when lying down. Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is a type of breathing support that is usually delivered through a mask over the nose, mouth, or both. It may help decrease the discomfort some people with ALS experience while breathing. At first, NIV may only be necessary at night, but people may eventually need it full time. As the disorder progresses, the person may need the support of respirators (mechanical ventilators) to breathe. Because the muscles that control breathing become weak, people with ALS also may have trouble creating a strong cough\u2014which can help clear the throat. There are several techniques to increase forceful coughing, including mechanical cough assistive devices. As ALS progresses, people need more and more help with daily activities. Being a caregiver for a person with ALS, while rewarding, can be challenging. It\u2019s important for caregivers to take care of themselves and to seek support when needed. Free and paid resources are available to provide home health care services and support. Visit the organizations listed at the end of this resource to find support in your area. NINDS, a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is the primary federal funder of research on the brain and nervous system, including disorders such as ALS. In 2023,NINDSpublishedstrategic priorities for ALS research(pdf, 1818 KB)(PDF, 1818 KB) to accelerate the development of effective interventions for the diagnosis, treatment, management, prevention, and cure of ALS. Scientists, clinicians, advocates, people affected by ALS, and the public provided input for the development of these strategic priorities. Under theAccelerating Access to Critical Therapies for ALS Act,NINDSalso funds research on expanded access for investigational new drugs to people living with ALS who aren\u2019t eligible for clinical trials. Scientific discoveries have resulted in the identification of multiple therapeutic targets for ALS. The FDA has approved one symptom-managing and four disorder-modifying ALS therapies, but the impact of these disorder-modifying therapies is modest. To develop truly effective ALS treatments, we must address many challenges. Thegoals of NINDS\u2019s ALS researchare to: Ongoing studies seek to understand the mechanisms that selectively trigger motor neurons to degenerate in ALS, which may lead to effective approaches to stop this process. Research using cellular culture systems and animal models suggests that motor neuron death is caused by a variety of cellular defects. This includes defects involved in protein recycling and gene regulation, as well as structural impairments in motor neurons. Increasing evidence also suggests that glial support cells and inflammation cells of the nervous system may play an important role in ALS. Scientists are turning adult skin and blood cells into stem cells that are capable of becoming any cell type, including motor neurons and other cells which may be involved in ALS. NINDS-funded scientists are using stem cells to grow human spinal cord sections on tissue chips to help better understand the function of neurons involved in ALS. Clinical research studies supported byNINDSare looking into how ALS symptoms change over time in people with C9orf72 mutations. Other studies are working to identify additional genes that may cause or put a person at risk for either familial or sporadic ALS. A large-scale collaborative research effort supported byNINDS, otherNIHinstitutes, and several public and private organizations is analyzing genetic data from thousands of people with ALS to discover new genes involved in the disorder. By using novel gene sequencing tools, researchers are now able to rapidly identify new genes in the human genome involved in ALS and other neurodegenerative disorders. People who carry genes associated with ALS may be able to participate in long-term, observational studies to help researchers understand how the disorder progresses over time in different populations. Additionally, researchers are looking at the potential role of epigenetics in ALS development. Epigenetic changes can switch genes on and off during a person\u2019s lifetime, which can greatly impact both health and disease. Although this research is exploratory, scientists hope that understanding epigenetics can offer new information about how ALS develops. NINDSsupports research on the development of biomarkers, biological signs of disease that can be found and measured. Tests can detect biomarkers in a person's blood, through brain scans, or in other ways. They can show whether a person has a disease or condition and how it's progressing over time. ALS biomarkers can help identify the rate of progression and the effectiveness of current and future therapies. For more information on research about ALS, checkNIH RePORTER, a searchable database of current and past research projects funded byNIHand other federal agencies. RePORTER also has links to publications and resources from these projects. For research articles and summaries on ALS , searchPubMed, which contains citations from medical journals and other sites. Clinical trials are studies that allow us to learn more about disorders and improve care. They can help connect patients with new and upcoming treatment options. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention developed theNational ALS Registry. The Registry collects, manages, and analyzes de-identified data about people with ALS in the U.S. It establishes information about the number of ALS cases, collects demographic, occupational, and environmental exposure data from people with ALS to learn about potential risk factors for the disorder, and notifies participants about research opportunities. The Registry includes data from national databases as well as de-identified information provided by people with ALS. All information is kept confidential. People with ALS can add their information to the registry and sign up to receive more information. Consider participating in a clinical trial so clinicians and scientists can learn more about ALS and related disorders. Clinical research with human study participants helps researchers learn more about a disorder and perhaps find better ways to safely detect, treat, or prevent disease. All types of study participants are needed\u2014those who are healthy or may have an illness or disease\u2014of all different ages, sexes, races, and ethnicities to ensure that study results apply to as many people as possible, and that treatments will be safe and effective for everyone who will use them. For information about participating in clinical research visit theNINDS Clinical Trials siteandNIH Clinical Research Trials and You. Learn about clinical trials currently looking for people with ALS atClinicalTrials.gov, a searchable database of current and past clinical studies and research results. NINDSalso supports theNIH NeuroBioBank, a collaborative effort involving several brain banks across the U.S. that supply investigators with tissue from people with neurological and other disorders. Tissue from people with ALS is needed to help advance critical research on the disorder. A single donated brain can make a huge impact on ALS research, potentially providing information for hundreds of studies. The goal is to increase the availability of, and access to, high quality specimens for research to understand the neurological basis of the disorder.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a nervous system disease that attacks nerve cells called neurons in your brain and spinal cord. These neurons transmit messages from your brain and spinal cord to your voluntary muscles - the ones you can control, like in your arms and legs. At first, this causes mild muscle problems. Some people notice: Eventually, you lose your strength and cannot move. When muscles in your chest fail, you cannot breathe. A breathing machine can help, but most people with ALS die fromrespiratory failure. The disease usually strikes between age 40 and 60. More men than women get it. No one knows what causes ALS. It can run in families, but usually it strikes at random. There is no cure. Medicines can relieve symptoms and, sometimes, prolong survival.

Download our ALS Impact Sheet The causes of the vast majority of ALS cases are still unknown. Investigators theorize that some individuals may be genetically predisposed to developing the disease but do so only after coming into contact with an environmental trigger. The interaction of genetics and environment may hold clues as to why some individuals develop ALS. Although the majority of ALS cases are sporadic, meaning there is no family history of the disease, about 10% of cases are familial, meaning the disease runs in the family. A common misconception is that only familial ALS is \"genetic.\" Actually, both familial and sporadic ALS can stem from genetic causes, and some people who have a diagnosis of sporadic ALS may carry ALS-causing genetic mutations that can be passed on to offspring. A genetic counselor can help people with ALS understand inheritance and any associated risks for family members. For a more detailed discussion of possible causes of sporadic ALS and the genetics of familial ALS, please seeCauses/Inheritance. ALS results in muscles that are reduced in size (atrophic), weak, and soft, or muscles that are stiff, tight, and spastic. Muscle twitches and cramps are common. Symptoms may begin anywhere in the body, including in the limbs, the bulbar region (the area supplied by the motor neurons in the brainstem) or, rarely, in the diaphragm that supports breathing. Symptoms may be limited to a single body region or may affect more than one region. When ALS begins in the bulbar motor neurons the muscles used for swallowing and speaking are affected first. As ALS progresses, symptoms become more widespread, and some muscles become profoundly weak while others are weakened or unaffected. In late-stage ALS, most voluntary muscles become unusable, either from severe weakness or increased tone. The involuntary muscles, such as those that control the heart, gastrointestinal tract and bowel, bladder, and sexual functions are not directly affected by ALS. Sensations, such as vision, hearing, and touch, are also unaffected. In many cases, ALS does not affect a person's thinking ability. However, a small subset of individuals will develop frontotemporal dementia manifested as behavioral abnormalities and a severe language disorder. An additional 30-40% of people with ALS develop some degree of executive function disorder. For more information on ALS symptoms, seeSigns and SymptomsandMedical Management.  Each person's disease course is unique. From the time of diagnosis, most individuals will live for three to five years. Around 30% of ALS patients are alive beyond five years after diagnosis, and 10-20% of patients survive 10 years or more. Survival beyond 20 years is possible but rare. Factors associated with more favorable survival rates include a younger age, male gender, and limb rather than bulbar symptom onset. For more information on the disease course, seeMedical Management. Medical interventions and technology have vastly improved the quality of life for people with ALS by assisting with breathing, nutrition, mobility, and communication. Proper management of symptoms, and proactive use of medical interventions and equipment, can make a positive difference in day-to-day living and potentially may lengthen life. In 1995, the glutamate blocker riluzole (Rilutek) became the first treatment approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat ALS. In people with ALS, the neuronal signaling molecule glutamate accumulates abnormally in the brain and causes death of motor neurons. Rilutek blocks the release of glutamate, thereby protecting motor neurons from cell death. Alternative formulations of Rilutek have been developed, to potentially increase accessibilty for individuals who have difficulty swallowing. Tiglutek, an oral liquid formulation of Rilutek was approved in 2018 and, Exservan, an oral formulation of Rilutek that dissolves on the tongue, was approved in the US in 2021. For more information, see press releases forTiglutik approvalandExservan approval. Dextromethorphan HBr and quinidine sulfate (Nuedexta) was approved in 2010, for treatment of pseudobulbar affect (PBA), a condition experienced by 15-45% ALS patients. PBA is manifested as exaggerated or inappropriate emotional responses including laughter and crying that is unwanted by the individual. On May 5, 2017, the FDA approved edaravone (Radicava) for the treatment of ALS. Radicava is an intravenous (IV) therapy for adults. For more information, seeFDA Approves Radicava to Treat ALS. On May 12, 2022, the FDA granted approval to oral edaravone (RADICAVA ORS) for the treatment of ALS. Radicava is thought to protect neurons from the damage caused by oxidative stress in people with ALS. Most recently, on April 25, 2023, the FDA granted accelerated approval of tofersen (Qalsody) for the treatment of ALS associated with mutation in the superoxide dismutase 1(SOD1)gene (SOD1-ALS). Qalsody is the first therapy to target a genetic cause of ALS. Qalsody is administered once monthly intrathecally. A number of strategies and approaches are being tested around the world, both in the laboratory and in human clinical trials. MDA's basic science program is constantly pursuing new avenues of research to understand the underlying causes of ALS, with a sharp focus on developing treatments. One of the most significant breakthroughs in the last decade has been the discovery of a number of genes that, when flawed, cause ALS. In fact, the genes responsible for causing the majority of the familial forms of ALS are now known \u2014 with some of these genes also having been found to be involved in sporadic ALS. Identification of these genes is crucial to moving research forward because it allows researchers to better understand the causes of ALS and design therapies to target them. For details about current ALS research, go toResearchandClinical Trials. MDA takes a big-picture perspective on neuromuscular diseases, including ALS, so we can work across conditions to find effective treatments and cures. With our collective strength, we encourage early diagnosis and action, support families in hometowns across the country, and uncover research breakthroughs to help everyone with ALS live longer, stronger lives.

        "content": " There are currently no treatments to stop the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However,there are now three drugs available that provide some benefits to people living with ALS.Two drugs have been approved in the US for use by all people with ALS: riluzole and edaravone (Radicava). An additional drug, tofersen (Qalsody), was approved in early 2023 for use by people with SOD1-related genetic ALS.An additional drug, Relyvrio, received  approval in the US and conditional approval Canada based on results from a phase 2 study, but was voluntarily removed from the market in 2024 after its phase 3 trial failed to meet its primary or secondary endpoints. Riluzole, currently sold under the brand names Rilutek, Tiglutik, and Exservan became the first drug approved in the US for the treatment of ALS in 1995.These three brand names represent different formulations of the drug respectively as a tablet, a liquid suspension, or a film that can dissolve in the mouth. The drug reduces the level of glutamate, an amino acid that acts as a neurotransmitter in the brain and spinal cord, by blocking its release from nerve terminals. While glutamate is essential to neural function, above-normal levels of the amino acid have been observed in ALS. Trial Results:There were two pivotal trials that led to the approval of riluzole, one with155 participants, and the second with959 participants. \u00a0These trials showed a two to three-month survival benefit for people with ALS that received active drug. \u00a0More recently,a 2020 publication evaluating real world evidenceof Riluzole\u2019s effectiveness indicated a median survival benefit for people taking riluzole could range from 6 to 19 months. Edaravone, sold under the brand name Radicava, was approved for use in ALS in 2017.It had previously been used since the 1980s as a medication for stroke in Japan. For most of this time, it was available only as an intravenous infusion. However, in 2022an oral formulation was approvedfor people with ALS in the US and Canada. Edaravone\u2019s mechanism of action in ALS is not fully understood, but it is known to be an antioxidant and thus may reduce oxidative stress in motor neurons. Trial Results:Radicava was approved following a phase 3 trial with 137 participants conducted in Japan by Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma. Researchers observeda reduction in participants\u2019 rates of disease progressionwith a difference of 2.49 ALSFRS-r points between the active treatment and placebo groups over 24 weeks. The inclusion criteria for this pivotal trial were based onapost-hoc analysisfrom a previous trial of the drug. Trial participants were required to have a FVC breathing score of at least 80%, less than 2 years duration of ALS symptoms, at least 2 points on each of the ALSFRS-r items, as well as a decline of 1-4 ALSFRS-r points over 3 months prior to randomization. In 2024, another company, Ferrer, reported topline results from a phase 3randomized-controlled trialof 300 people with ALS in Europe who took an oral formulation of edaravone over 48 weeks, double the length of Radicava's pivotal trial. The dosefor this trial was 100 mg once daily, while Radicava ORS contains 105 mg that is dosed once daily for10 days every monthafter the initial dose which is administered daily for 14 days. While still pending full results and publication, this trialdid not show either a slowing of progression or increase in survival. MT Pharma hasaddressed these results and the differences between this trial and their previous studies of Radicava. Tofersen, sold under the brand name Qalsody, is an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), a short strand of nucleic acids that can enter a cell and bind with mRNA strands, in this case effectively \u201cturning down\u201d a gene and disrupting the production of a specific protein.Tofersen binds to SOD1 mRNA, reducing the production of the SOD1 protein, which has now shown to be protective against SOD1 ALS. It is delivered through an intrathecal injection into the spinal cord. Trial Results:Althoughthe phase 3\u00a0trialwith 108 participants did not meet its primary functional endpoint,this drug wasapproved for use by people with SOD1 ALS in early 2023based on reductions in levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL), a blood-based biomarker that is related to neurodegeneration, in participants on active drug.This approval was secured through the FDA\u2019s accelerated approval pathway, which allows the agency to approve treatments based on \u201csurrogate endpoints\u201d for severe diseases that lack treatments. A surrogate endpoint is a measure in a clinical trial that scientists believe is likely to predict a clinical benefit, even if a clinical benefit is not directly observed in the trial. In addition to the reduction in NfL, in post hoc analyses of data from participants that continued to the open label extension (OLE), at 52 weeks, there was a slowing of loss of function, based on ALSFRS-r, for those that received active drug from the beginning of the trial compared to those that began on placebo. There was also less decline in breathing function and strength when comparing these groups at 52 weeks. Additionally, some participants stayed on OLE \u00a0for 3-7 years, providing long term data on the drug\u2019s performance in people with ALS. Anadditional trial of Qalsody for clinically Presymptomatic carriers of some ALS-related SOD1 mutationsis ongoing as of March 2025. While Relyvrio is still currently approved for ALS in the US as of May, 2025, Amylyx has announced they will voluntarily remove it frommarket afteritsPhase 3 trialdid not meet primary or secondary endpoints. It was available as a powder which was dissolved in water and either swallowed or placed in a feeding tube. Trial Results:A phase 2 trial sponsored by Amylyx Pharmaceuticals in 137 people with ALS demonstratedevidence of a decline in the rate of progression, a difference of 2.32 ALSFRS-r points, between the active treatment and placebo groups over 24 weeks. \u00a0A post-hoc analysis of the open label extension data, where participants could choose to receive active treatment following the placebo controlled part of the trial, showed a potentialincrease in survival of 5 monthswhen comparing those that began active treatment from the start of the trial to those that received placebo.In 2022, the drug wasapproved for use in the USand received conditional approval in Canada, where it was sold under the brand name Albrioza. On March 8, 2024, Amylyxannounced topline results for its Phase 3trial, PHOENIX, sharing that the study \u201cdid not meet pre-specified primary or secondary endpoints.\u201dFour weeks later, Amylyxannounced their intention to voluntarily remove the drugfrom market. The approval of all these treatments \u2013 including two in the last year \u2013 is an immensely important step for the ALS community.However, at the ALS Therapy Development Institute (ALS TDI), we know it will take many more treatments to end ALS for everyone with the disease.That\u2019s why every day we\u2019re working to identify effective treatments for the disease. As theDrug Discovery Engine for ALS, it is our mission to continue this work until there are effective treatments for the disease.

Inf\u00f3rmese sobre el funcionamiento del gobierno federal y el reinicio de las actividades enopm.gov. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), formerly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a neurological disorder that affects motor neurons. Motor neurons are the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord that control voluntary muscle movement and breathing. As motor neurons degenerate and die, they stop sending messages to the muscles. This causes the muscles to weaken, start to twitch (fasciculations), and waste away (atrophy). Eventually, in people with ALS, the brain loses its ability to start and control voluntary movements such as walking, talking, chewing and other functions, as well as breathing. ALS is progressive, meaning symptoms get worse over time. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved several drugs for ALS that may prolong survival, reduce the rate of decline, or help manage symptoms. But there\u2019s currently no known treatment that stops or reverses the progression of ALS. Early symptoms include: As the disorder progresses, muscle weakness and atrophy spread to other parts of the body. People with ALS may develop problems with: Eventually, people with ALS become unable to stand or walk, get in or out of bed on their own, use their hands and arms, or breathe on their own. Because they usually remain able to reason, remember, and understand, they are aware of their progressive loss of function. This can cause anxiety and depression in the person with ALS and their loved ones. Although not as common, people with ALS also may experience problems with language or decision-making. Some also developa form of dementia known as FTD-ALS. Most people with ALS die from being unable to breathe on their own (known as respiratory failure), usually within three to five years of symptoms first appearing. But about 1 in 10 people survive for 10 years or more. A risk factor is a condition or behavior, like high blood pressure or smoking, that increases the likelihood of having a certain health problem compared to those who don't have the risk factor. Having a risk factor doesn't mean a person will develop ALS, and not having a risk factor doesn't mean they won\u2019t. Risk factors for ALS include: Some studies suggest military veterans are about one and a half to two times more likely to develop ALS, although the reason for this is unclear. Possible risk factors for veterans include exposure to lead, pesticides, and other environmental toxins. Some studies have also shown that head injury can be associated with higher risk for ALS, but more research is needed to understand this connection. Nearly all cases of ALS are considered sporadic, meaning the disorder seems to happen at random with no clearly associated risk factors and no family history. Although family members of people with ALS are at an increased risk for the disorder the overall risk is very low\u2014most won\u2019t develop ALS. About 10% of all ALS cases are familial (also called inherited or genetic). Mutations (changes) in more than a dozen genes have been found to cause familial ALS. For example: In 2021, a team of scientists led by the National Institutes of Health and the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences announced it had discovereda unique form of genetic ALS that affects children as young as 4 years. This childhood form is linked to the gene SPTLC1 that is part of the body's fat production system and may be caused by changes in the way the body uses fatty materials (lipids). It\u2019s important to get an accurate ALS diagnosis as soon as possible. ALS treatments may be most effective soon after symptoms start. A neurologist familiar with ALS can help a person get diagnosed early. There is no single test that can definitely diagnose ALS. A doctor will conduct a physical exam and review the person\u2019s full medical history. A neurologic examination will test reflexes, muscle strength, and other responses. These tests should be performed at regular intervals to assess whether symptoms are getting worse over time. A doctor may conduct muscle and imaging tests to rule out other disorders. This can help support an ALS diagnosis. One test is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce detailed images of the brain and spinal cord. Another is electromyography (EMG), which evaluates how well nerves and muscles are functioning. An EMG can include: Other tests can rule out the possibility of other disorders. They can include: Find out more about neurological diagnostic tests and procedures. There\u2019s no treatment to reverse damage to motor neurons or cure ALS at this time. But some treatments may slow progression of the disorder, improve quality of life, and extend survival. New treatments have become available in the past several years, and researchers continue to explore different options to slow or stop progression of ALS. Integrated, multi-disciplinary teams of professionals are best prepared to provide supportive health care. These teams can design an individualized treatment plan and provide special equipment aimed at keeping people as mobile, comfortable, and independent as possible. They may include: Doctors may use the following medicines approved by the FDA to support a treatment plan for ALS: Sodium phenylbutyrate/taurursodiol (Relyvrio) is an oral medicine that was proposed to prevent nerve cell death by blocking stress signals in cells. The FDA approved Relyvrio based on safety and efficacy data from a single, smaller ALS clinical trial in September 2022. But a larger clinical trial failed to confirm the earlier findings, and the manufacturer of Relyvrio removed the drug from the market in 2024. A doctor may prescribe other medicines or treatments to help manage symptoms\u2014including muscle cramps and stiffness, excessive saliva and phlegm, and unwanted episodes of crying, laughing, or other emotional displays. Medicines may also help with any pain, depression, sleep problems, or constipation. A treatment plan for ALS usually includes rehabilitation, which should be tailored to the person\u2019s individual needs. It may include physical, occupational, and speech therapy. Physical therapy can help people with ALS maintain function and movement. This includes lowering their risk of falls and joint pain and maximizing their independence at different stages of the disorder. Low-impact exercises such as walking, swimming, or using a stationary exercise bike\u2014along with range of motion exercises\u2014can help maintain muscle strength and function. Occupational therapists can help with daily living and self-care activities. They can also suggest assistive devices for feeding, bathing, and grooming so that the person can be as independent as possible. Speech therapists can help people with ALS learn strategies to speak louder and more clearly\u2014and help maintain the ability to communicate. Computer-based speech synthesizers use eye-tracking devices that allow a person to use the internet and to type on custom screens to communicate. People with ALS sometimes use voice banking, a process that stores their own voice for future use in computer-based speech synthesizers. A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a system that allows people to communicate or control equipment such as a wheelchair using only brain activity. Researchers are developing more efficient, mobile BCIs for people with severe paralysis or visual impairments. People with ALS may have trouble chewing and swallowing their food, and getting the nutrients they need. Nutritionists and registered dieticians can help plan small, nutritious meals throughout the day\u2014and identify foods to avoid. When the person can no longer eat with help, a feeding tube can reduce the person\u2019s risk of choking and pneumonia. As the muscles responsible for breathing start to weaken, people with ALS may have shortness of breath during physical activity and difficulty breathing at night or when lying down. Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is a type of breathing support that is usually delivered through a mask over the nose, mouth, or both. It may help decrease the discomfort some people with ALS experience while breathing. At first, NIV may only be necessary at night, but people may eventually need it full time. As the disorder progresses, the person may need the support of respirators (mechanical ventilators) to breathe. Because the muscles that control breathing become weak, people with ALS also may have trouble creating a strong cough\u2014which can help clear the throat. There are several techniques to increase forceful coughing, including mechanical cough assistive devices. As ALS progresses, people need more and more help with daily activities. Being a caregiver for a person with ALS, while rewarding, can be challenging. It\u2019s important for caregivers to take care of themselves and to seek support when needed. Free and paid resources are available to provide home health care services and support. Visit the organizations listed at the end of this resource to find support in your area. NINDS, a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is the primary federal funder of research on the brain and nervous system, including disorders such as ALS. In 2023,NINDSpublishedstrategic priorities for ALS research(pdf, 1818 KB)(PDF, 1818 KB) to accelerate the development of effective interventions for the diagnosis, treatment, management, prevention, and cure of ALS. Scientists, clinicians, advocates, people affected by ALS, and the public provided input for the development of these strategic priorities. Under theAccelerating Access to Critical Therapies for ALS Act,NINDSalso funds research on expanded access for investigational new drugs to people living with ALS who aren\u2019t eligible for clinical trials. Scientific discoveries have resulted in the identification of multiple therapeutic targets for ALS. The FDA has approved one symptom-managing and four disorder-modifying ALS therapies, but the impact of these disorder-modifying therapies is modest. To develop truly effective ALS treatments, we must address many challenges. Thegoals of NINDS\u2019s ALS researchare to: Ongoing studies seek to understand the mechanisms that selectively trigger motor neurons to degenerate in ALS, which may lead to effective approaches to stop this process. Research using cellular culture systems and animal models suggests that motor neuron death is caused by a variety of cellular defects. This includes defects involved in protein recycling and gene regulation, as well as structural impairments in motor neurons. Increasing evidence also suggests that glial support cells and inflammation cells of the nervous system may play an important role in ALS. Scientists are turning adult skin and blood cells into stem cells that are capable of becoming any cell type, including motor neurons and other cells which may be involved in ALS. NINDS-funded scientists are using stem cells to grow human spinal cord sections on tissue chips to help better understand the function of neurons involved in ALS. Clinical research studies supported byNINDSare looking into how ALS symptoms change over time in people with C9orf72 mutations. Other studies are working to identify additional genes that may cause or put a person at risk for either familial or sporadic ALS. A large-scale collaborative research effort supported byNINDS, otherNIHinstitutes, and several public and private organizations is analyzing genetic data from thousands of people with ALS to discover new genes involved in the disorder. By using novel gene sequencing tools, researchers are now able to rapidly identify new genes in the human genome involved in ALS and other neurodegenerative disorders. People who carry genes associated with ALS may be able to participate in long-term, observational studies to help researchers understand how the disorder progresses over time in different populations. Additionally, researchers are looking at the potential role of epigenetics in ALS development. Epigenetic changes can switch genes on and off during a person\u2019s lifetime, which can greatly impact both health and disease. Although this research is exploratory, scientists hope that understanding epigenetics can offer new information about how ALS develops. NINDSsupports research on the development of biomarkers, biological signs of disease that can be found and measured. Tests can detect biomarkers in a person's blood, through brain scans, or in other ways. They can show whether a person has a disease or condition and how it's progressing over time. ALS biomarkers can help identify the rate of progression and the effectiveness of current and future therapies. For more information on research about ALS, checkNIH RePORTER, a searchable database of current and past research projects funded byNIHand other federal agencies. RePORTER also has links to publications and resources from these projects. For research articles and summaries on ALS , searchPubMed, which contains citations from medical journals and other sites. Clinical trials are studies that allow us to learn more about disorders and improve care. They can help connect patients with new and upcoming treatment options. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention developed theNational ALS Registry. The Registry collects, manages, and analyzes de-identified data about people with ALS in the U.S. It establishes information about the number of ALS cases, collects demographic, occupational, and environmental exposure data from people with ALS to learn about potential risk factors for the disorder, and notifies participants about research opportunities. The Registry includes data from national databases as well as de-identified information provided by people with ALS. All information is kept confidential. People with ALS can add their information to the registry and sign up to receive more information. Consider participating in a clinical trial so clinicians and scientists can learn more about ALS and related disorders. Clinical research with human study participants helps researchers learn more about a disorder and perhaps find better ways to safely detect, treat, or prevent disease. All types of study participants are needed\u2014those who are healthy or may have an illness or disease\u2014of all different ages, sexes, races, and ethnicities to ensure that study results apply to as many people as possible, and that treatments will be safe and effective for everyone who will use them. For information about participating in clinical research visit theNINDS Clinical Trials siteandNIH Clinical Research Trials and You. Learn about clinical trials currently looking for people with ALS atClinicalTrials.gov, a searchable database of current and past clinical studies and research results. NINDSalso supports theNIH NeuroBioBank, a collaborative effort involving several brain banks across the U.S. that supply investigators with tissue from people with neurological and other disorders. Tissue from people with ALS is needed to help advance critical research on the disorder. A single donated brain can make a huge impact on ALS research, potentially providing information for hundreds of studies. The goal is to increase the availability of, and access to, high quality specimens for research to understand the neurological basis of the disorder.

Many rare diseases have limited information. Currently, GARD aims to provide the following information for this disease:  A biological parent can sometimes pass down genetic changes, called mutations, that cause a disease or increase the chances of developing it. This is called inheritance. Knowing if other family members have had the disease, also known as your family health history, can give your medical team important information.The Surgeon General offers a tool to help you collect your family health history. 46 Symptoms 46 Symptoms 46 Symptoms  If a diagnosis remains unclear, visiting a multidisciplinary care center or university hospital may help. These centers bring together teams of specialists who can work together to evaluate symptoms and coordinate a diagnosis. This team-based approach is also helpful after a diagnosis, when managing care for rare diseases. Because only about 5% of rare diseases have FDA-approved treatments, finding the right healthcare team to manage your symptoms and overall health is essential. People living with rare diseases often face challenges such as delayed diagnosis, limited treatment options, and difficulty accessing knowledgeable providers. Building a care team that understands your needs can make a significant difference in your quality of life. Building the right health care team is key to the diagnosis, treatment, and management of your long-term health journey living with a rare disease. Start by choosing a primary care provider (PCP). Your PCP will be your main point of contact and help coordinate care with other medical professionals. Your PCP may order tests or refer you to specialists.To find a PCP near you, use the Medicare provider search tooland enter your location and \u00e2\u0080\u009cPrimary Care Provider.\u00e2\u0080\u009d   Seeing multiple specialists is important for people with rare diseases because these conditions often affect many parts of the body and require care from doctors with different expertise. Most primary care providers may not be familiar with rare diseases, so involving specialists can lead to a more accurate diagnosis and better care. A coordinated team approach ensures that all symptoms are addressed and that care is well-managed. It can also connect patients with the latest research or treatment options.  If you've visited your PCP, met with specialists, and undergone the recommended tests, but are still searching for a diagnosis, it may be time to visit an academic medical center or, for pediatric patients, a children's hospital. Academic medical centers and children's hospitals, often called multidisciplinary care centers, typically bring together specialists from different fields to work together on complex cases like rare diseases.   Multidisciplinary care centers may offer more coordinated care and be involved in clinical research, which may help reduce the time to diagnosis and provide access to emerging diagnostic tools. Specialists at these centers may have a deeper understanding of rare diseases and serve as a resource when you'd like a second opinion, particularly when test results or treatment plans are not delivering expected results.  Use this toolto find hospitals that may partner with medical schools and programs in your area.

        "content": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)is a disease that weakens the muscles we use to move, swallow and breathe. It can, in some cases, also cause changes in behavior and thinking. The effects of ALS grow more severe over time and eventually become fatal.\u00a0The symptoms and progression of ALS may vary greatly from person to person, which can make the disease difficult to diagnose, manage and treat. There is no cure for ALS yet. But the pace of research has significantly increased in recent years, and organizations like the Les Turner ALS Foundation are ready to provide help and support to people living with ALS, caregivers and everyone affected by the disease. The most important thing to know is that you are not alone in fighting ALS.We're here for youevery step of the way. How long do people live with ALS? The average survival for someone with ALS is two to five years. However, it is very important to note thatALS progresses at different rates in each person. Some people with ALS survive five to ten years or more. Scientists have made a great deal of progress understanding the disease in recent years, but there is still much that we need to learn, which makes it difficult to predict how ALS will affect each individual. Although there is no cure yet, there are things that people with ALS can do right now to help maintain and improve their quality of life. There are FDA-approved treatments that can slow the progression of the disease, and clinicians at multidisciplinary centers like theLois Insolia ALS Clinichave expertise in pulmonology (breathing) and neurology (the brain, spinal cord and nerves) that can help improve health and extend survival. Connect with our ALS support services teamto learn about support options and how to work toward the best quality of life for you and your loved ones. What treatments are available for ALS? Decisions regarding medication should be made in consultation with your doctor and should be part of a comprehensive treatment approach. There is no cure for ALS, but several therapies have been approved by the FDA to slow or treat symptoms. Rilutekwas the first FDA-approved medication for the treatment of ALS, approved in 1995. It has been proven to modestly increase lifespan. It is available asRiluzole(pill form),Tiglutik(liquid form) andExservan(oral film form) by prescription. Nuedextawas approved by the FDA in 2011 to treat pseudobulbar affect, a symptom that can occur in ALS and other neurological conditions, which is characterized by uncontrollable laughing and crying. In 2017, the FDA approvedRadicava, an infusion treatment from Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma America. It is also known as edaravone. According to the FDA, the pivotal clinical trial for Radicava in Japan showed a 33% slowing of loss of function in participants as rated on the ALS Functional Rating Scale. In 2022, the FDA approvedRadicava ORS(liquid form) which can be taken orally or via feeding tube. In 2023, the FDA granted accelerated approval of Biogen\u2019sQalsodyfor SOD1-ALS. It isthe first FDA-approved treatment to target a genetic cause of ALS.Study results suggest that an early start and extended use of Qalsody may help stabilize muscle strength, respiratory function and quality of life. Qalsody is administered intrathecally (through a spinal injection). Unfortunately, ALS treatments that show promise in early clinical trials do not always prove to be effective when tested with larger groups. For example, the FDA approved a treatment calledRelyvrioin 2022, but it was later withdrawn from the market when shown to be no better than a placebo in a subsequent clinical trial. Clinical trials at centers such as the Lois Insolia ALS Clinic continue to search for better and more effective treatments. Are there ALS clinical trials or research studies? The Lois Insolia ALS Clinic at the Les Turner ALS Center at Northwestern Medicine is actively involved inseveral multi-center drug trials. Clinical research in ALS\u00a0encompasses a broad range of work, including biomarker studies, open label therapeutic studies, natural history studies and clinical trials. There are a number of ongoing clinical trials in ALS that have the potential to slow down disease progression and/or manage symptoms. Choosing to participate in a study is an important personal decision. We encourage you to talk with your doctor and family or friends about deciding to join a study.

Researchers think that genetics, environment, and age play a role in the development of ALS. However, the cause of ALS is not yet known, and scientists do not know why ALS strikes some people and not others. As of 2017, there were an estimated 32,000 people living with ALS in the U.S. While technically considered a \u201crare disease,\u201d researchers predict an individual\u2019s life time risk of acquiring ALS is about 1 in 300 by the age of 85. Although known genetic mutations occur in less than 20% of people living with ALS, everyone regardless of clinical presentation or family history, has the option of genetic counseling and genetic testing. What are the symptoms of ALS? While no two people with ALS are alike or will progress the same way, an ALS care team can help people manage their symptoms and offer access to therapeutic treatment and clinical research. ALScancause: weaknessin the arms and legs twitching and rippling sensationsunder the skin (known as fasciculations) muscle tightness and cramping(which may cause pain) problems with breathingandextreme tiredness difficulties with speech, swallowingandsaliva ALSmaycause: changes in thinkingandreasoning changes in behaviorsuch as crying, laughing or yawning too much (also known as pseudobulbar affect) frontotemporal dementia (FTD)a rare but more severe form of changes to behavior and thinking ALS usuallydoes notaffect: sensessight, hearing, smell, touch and taste are typically unchanged bladderalthough mobility problems can make it more difficult to get to the toilet and some people have a more frequent urge to urinate bowelsalthough lack of mobility, nutrition and breathing problems can cause constipation sexual functionpeople living with ALS can continue to enjoy intimacy with their loved ones, though some adaptation will be needed as the disease progresses How is ALS diagnosed? It may take time to receive a diagnosis of ALS, as there is no single, definitive test. Often, tests will be administered to rule out illnesses with similar symptoms. These may include a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain or spinal cord, an electromyography (EMG) study of nerve and muscle function, and a variety of blood and urine tests. After reviewing these test results and medical history, and performing a complete neurological exam, a neuromuscular neurologist can usually reach a diagnosis. It may take several months of observation and retesting to reach a definitive diagnosis, which should be confirmed via a second opinion from another neuromuscular specialist. How can people living with ALS take control of their own care? Clinic visits provide a lot of information. It can feel overwhelming and it can be difficult to remember specific questions for your care team. We encourage you toprepare for your ALS clinic visitby making lists of the different ways ALS is impacting you and writing down specific questions. We suggest bringing a notebook and pen and asking a family member or friend to take notes. There may be several people who participate in your care and new ones may be introduced along the way. We recommend using a tool like theMy ALS Communication Passport to Quality Careto record information about your day-to-day routines, such as how you wish to communicate and obtain nutrition and hydration, your preferred method of pain/anxiety management and your personal likes and dislikes.

Since 1979, the Les Turner ALS Foundation has supported ALS research at Northwestern University. This research has played a critical role in moving the field forward, improving understanding of the causes of ALS and developing strategies to slow progression of the disease. Today, under the leadership ofRobert G. Kalb, MD, the Joan and Paul Rubschlager Professor and Chief of the Division of Neuromuscular Medicine, the Les Turner ALS Center comprises more than 70 members working across Northwestern's Chicago and Evanston campuses, uniting expertise across scientific disciplines to generate new insights and significant advances in the fight against ALS. In 2023,nearly $1 million in ALS grantswere awarded at the Les Turner ALS Center, thanks to thesupport of our generous donors. An International Leader in ALS Research Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicineis known worldwide for groundbreaking medical research. As part of theKen and Ruth Davee Department of Neurology, the Les Turner ALS Center unites all ALS research and educational activities at the university with the comprehensive multidisciplinary care provided at theLois Insolia ALS ClinicandNorthwestern Medicine, which also offers access toALS clinical trials and research. In 1979, the Les Turner ALS Foundation dedicated the first ALS-focused research laboratory at Northwestern University Medical School, under the direction of Dr. Burk Jubelt.Since then, the Foundation has directly funded over $32 million in ALS research and clinical care at the Les Turner ALS Center at Northwestern Medicine, as well as millions more in indirect funding. The Les Turner ALS Center also hosts one of the world's leading annual events for scientists, clinicians and people living with ALS to share research insights about the disease, theLes Turner Symposium on ALS. \u201cMany important insights have come from Les Turner ALS Center laboratories,\" notes Dr. Kalb. \"These include the identification of new ALS causing genes, an increased understanding of the pathological events that lead to loss of upper motor neurons, insights into nuclear membrane biology, and motor neuron death.\u201d Among the transformative discoveries at the Les Turner ALS Center was Dr. Teepu Siddique's 1993 co-discovery of SOD-1, the first genetic mutation linked to cause ALS. In 2009,the FUS gene was discoveredas part of a national collaboration directed by Dr. Siddique. Advances like these have laid essential groundwork for targeted therapies in ALS, such as in 2023, when QalsodyTM(tofersen) becamethe first FDA-approved treatment for a genetic form of ALS. Withnearly $1 million in ALS grants awardedin 2023, the Les Turner ALS Center continues to bring fresh ideas into the field and foster collaboration among talented and dedicated researchers who are working to create a world free of ALS. Investing in the Future of ALS Research Jointly with Northwestern Medicine, the Les Turner ALS Foundation has embarked on a campaign to raise $10 million over the course of ten years to permanently endow the Les Turner ALS Center. Currently, we\u2019ve raised over $5 million toward that endowment. Additionally, the Foundation has committed to funding at least $1 million annually to the Lois Insolia ALS Clinic and ALS research conducted across all disciplines of Northwestern's Feinberg School of Medicine. The support of our visionary donors makes this life-changing research possible.   Joan and Paul Rubschlager: A Transformational Gift The Les Turner ALS Foundation is honored and grateful for the generosity of Joan and Paul Rubschlager who donated $3 million to the endowment at the Les Turner ALS Center at Northwestern Medicine. The Rubschlagers are native Chicagoans and have been married for more than 50 years. For 100 years, the family operated the Rubschlager Baking Corporation founded in 1913. They have been active supporters of the Foundation since the 1980\u2019s after Paul lost his father to ALS in 1975. \u201cWhen Paul\u2019s father was diagnosed with ALS, there was nowhere to turn,\u201d said Joan Rubschlager. \u201cWe want to make sure that no family ever feels that they have no one to help them. By supporting the Les Turner ALS Center, we are ensuring that there will always be hope and help for those who need it most.\" The Harold Post Research Endowment Harold Post was a major gifts consultant for the United Jewish Appeal when he was diagnosed with ALS in 1984 at age 45. He used his fundraising talents to raise awareness and funds, reaching out to friends, family, colleagues, and the larger community to raise over $250,00 for ALS research. In 1993, the Harold Post Research Endowment was established at the Les Turner ALS Center at Northwestern Medicine, where it has enabled transformative research like the2009 discovery of the FUS gene mutationand continues to support ALS investigators today. Harold continued to work with unwavering determination throughout his failing health with the hope that effective treatments and a cure would become a reality for individuals with ALS. He died in 1997. Harold\u2019s wife Judith, their four children, and their families continue to support the fight against ALS. Vickie and Loren Semler Research Fund The Semler Research Fund is dedicated to funding research until a cure for ALS is found. \u201cVickie and I would like to know that this important research is still being done, even after we are gone,\" said Loren Semler. \"We hope our support will inspire others to do the same.\u201d Unfortunately, Vickie lost her battle with ALS on June 28, 2016. Knowing scientists at Northwestern Medicine are working tirelessly to find a treatment gives the Semler family hope for others who are suffering with this disease.

Together, you and your care team can find a treatment plan that works for you. Last Reviewed: April 22, 2024 If you\u2019re living with ALS, you can volunteer to participate in a type of scientific study called a clinical research study. Through clinical research, scientists and doctors can learn about ALS from people who\u2019ve experienced it firsthand, gain a deeper understanding of genetic differences linked to ALS, and test potential treatment options. There are many ways that people living with ALS can get involved in clinical research: If you join a clinical trial, you may try a new treatment option that\u2019s not available to the public yet. During a clinical trial, you will be monitored frequently. By participating in any type of clinical research, you can help researchers make scientific discoveries that will help people living with ALS in the future. For many people, participating in research can be an empowering experience. The first step is to learn about ALS clinical research from reliable sources. Talking to your doctor or ALS care team is a great place to start. They can walk you through the basics of clinical research and give you input based on your personal situation. You can also explore these online resources: ClinicalTrials.govis a central database of clinical trials for all health conditions, including ALS. All studies that are looking for participants in the United States (and most studies worldwide) are posted onClinicalTrials.gov. NEALS (NEALS.org)has a database of clinical research studies related to ALS. If you have questions about the database or you\u2019d like to learn more about a study, contact the Clinical Trial Liaison atalstrials@neals.orgor (855) 437-4823. The ALS Trial Navigator (ALS.net/ALSTrial-Navigator)is a comprehensive resource that guides people living with ALS as they learn more about finding and participating in clinical trials for ALS. After answering a few questions, you can learn about research opportunities, set personal priorities, and find trials that meet your criteria. The Navigator also has an interactive map to help you find trials in your area. If you have questions about ALS clinical research, you can reach out to the following organizations: If you have questions about a specific study listed onClinicalTrials.gov, you can reach out to the study team. Look for the Contacts and Locations table under each study. In addition to exploring clinical research, some people living with ALS consider trying alternative or off-label treatments (AOTs). ALSUntangled provides scientific reviews of AOTs to help people living with ALS make more informed decisions. Explore treatment reviews, questions and answers, podcast episodes, and more atALSUntangled.com. Next, look for clinical research studies that align with your needs. Ask your doctor or ALS care team if they know of any studies that might be a good fit for you based off the type of ALS you have. You can also use the websites listed under Step 1 to find studies. As you review study descriptions, look for information about where the study will happen and how long it will last. Some clinical trials test the same study drug in multiple locations, making it possible for more people to participate. Study descriptions may also list eligibility criteria, or rules about who can participate in the study. For example, researchers may be looking for people in a certain age group or people who have a specific type of ALS. If you find a study that you\u2019re interested in joining, contact the research team. If your doctor told you about the study, they can help you get in touch with the research team. If you found the study online, the study description will usually include contact information or an online form to fill out. If the research team thinks you may be a good fit for the study, they may ask you questions and review information about your health, like your: Based on all this information, the team will decide if you qualify to participate in the study.

The muscles that control your breathing may be too weak to breathe in enough oxygen and breathe out enough carbon dioxide. Because of this, you may have higher than normal levels of carbon dioxide in your blood. Your care team will usually recommend a \u201cNon-invasive ventilation\u201d or NIV (special breathing equipment).These machines help the respiratory muscles breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide.If oxygen levels are still low, supplemental oxygen may be added to these machines with an order from a pulmonologist. Using \u201csupplemental\u201d or extra oxygen will usually not help people living with ALS. In fact, it can be very dangerous. Supplemental oxygen can trick the brain into thinking that there is no need to breathe. Your ALS Guide has short educational respiratory videos for you to learn more about equipment and managing respiratory symptoms. YouTube Videos:bit.ly/als-respirationoryouralsguide.com People living with ALS may have trouble breathing while lying down flat. It might be helpful to use inclined support. These could include: To do breath stacking,sit tall and take 3-5 slow, deep breaths from the mouth without exhaling. This should be done twice a day. A nose clip can help make sure air doesn\u2019t escape from the nose while you are breath-stacking. If it is hard to breathe, an Ambu\u2122 bag with a mask can help. Watch this video,bit.ly/ambu-bagfor instructions or ask your pulmonologist during a clinic visit about breath stacking. \u201cNon-invasive ventilation\u201d or NIV is the use of special equipment to support breathing. Non-invasive means that it does not break the skin or require any surgery. It is also the preferred and most used form of ventilation in ALS care. People sometimes refer to non-invasive ventilation by other names. The most common ones are: NIV uses air pressure to help you breathe.\u00a0Here\u2019s how it works: To learn about NIV, answer a few questions to help you think through what is most important to you and get ready to talk with your ALS care team about your options. alsdecisions.org/breathing You have the option to choose between non-invasive\u00a0and invasive ventilation. \u201cInvasive\u201d means that a doctor will do surgery to place a breathing tube inside your windpipe (trachea). This is called a tracheostomy. You will most likely need to have a feeding tube placed. To learn more about feeding tubes visit,alsdecisions.org/nutrition. Invasive ventilation support may drastically change how you are cared for and communicate. Therefore, this very personal decision should be discussed and considered thoroughly. Give yourself time to consider how you want to live and experience the rest of your life. This decision impacts both you and your family in many ways, including financially and emotionally. Before a decision is made, advance directives should be in place. If you have private health insurance and are considering invasive ventilation support, it is important to first contact your insurance company. A person with invasive ventilation support requires 24-hour care from a caregiver, family member or nursing facility. Some insurance plans pay for an outside agency to provide part of this care. Medicare does not pay for such services. The tracheostomy site and equipment needs to be cleaned every day. This will help prevent lung infections. Secretions from the lungs must be regularly cleared from the tube with a disposable suction catheter. This will help keep the airways open. To find out more, visityouralsguide.com/invasivemechanical-ventilation To be taken off invasive ventilation, you must first be evaluated by a physician. You will then be admitted to hospice for removal of ventilation and end-of life-care. Removal from invasive ventilation may take place in the hospital or at an in-patient hospice unit. You would be given medications to ease any discomfort and make the final moments as peaceful as possible. After the invasive ventilation is disconnected, it may be minutes to hours before breathing ends completely. If traveling by air, the airline should be contacted before making a reservation. A car inverter can help when traveling or using respiratory devices in a car. With or without the use of NIV or invasive ventilation, your ALS care team may recommend palliative or hospice care. Palliative care won\u2019t help you live longer, but it can provide care and support to help you stay comfortable. Hospice care provides compassionate care and comfort at the end of life. A palliative care provider or ALS care team can give you medicine to help with your symptoms, other equipment and recommend exercises to help with your breathing, posture and cough.

This makes maintaining weight more difficult, so people with ALS need to increase their calories to maintain weight. The challenge is to increase the number of calories without significantly increasing the amount of food. A few ways to increase calories would be: Chewing and swallowing difficulties (dysphagia) may make mealtimes more challenging or tiring for you. Concentrating and eating more slowly may cause a sense of isolation due to others having already finished eating. As a result, you may not finish your meal leading to a decrease in caloric intake.

The difference between them is how the doctor looks\u00a0inside your stomach: Percutaneous Radiological Insertion ofGastrostomy (RIG):A special doctor called a\u00a0radiologist will take an X-ray of your stomach.\u00a0They carefully guide instruments through tiny\u00a0incisions in the skin to make an opening in\u00a0the stomach. You may have a Nasogastric\u00a0Tube placed temporarily the day before the\u00a0procedures. This is a flexible tube of rubber or\u00a0plastic that is passed through the nose, down\u00a0through the esophagus, and into the stomach\u00a0to ensure accurate feeding tube placement. Most ALS doctors recommend\u00a0the RIG procedure. Talk with\u00a0your ALS care team about\u00a0which type of procedure\u00a0is best for you.

Together, you and your care team can find a treatment plan that works for you. Last Reviewed: June 21, 2022 Becoming a caregiver for someone with ALS is likely something you never thought you would have to do, and your relationship with your loved one is bound to change. In this guide, you will find tips on how to handle changing relationship dynamics as well as information on ALS and physical intimacy. Our intention is to provide you with information that you may need today and tomorrow. It is a common misconception that ALS does not impact thinking and behavior. Recent studies show up to 50% of people living with ALS may eventually experience some change in cognitive functioning or behavior. Cognitive and behavioral impairment in ALS can vary from individual to individual. The person living with ALS may experience a change in personality, increased irritability, development of obsessions, and/or decreased insight, all of which can change the dynamics of your relationship. Your ALS care team is here for you and can help you navigate the challenges that come with cognitive and behavioral impairment. To learn more, read:Changes in Thinking and Behavior in ALSby the ALS Association. CommunicateCommunicate your needs and allow the person you are caring for to communicate their needs. Your ALS care team and speech-language pathologist can help with communication needs. Have patienceBe patient with each other during this time of transition. Enjoy time togetherContinue to do things you enjoy together! Engaging in meaningful activities together will help relieve stress for everyone. Accept your differences in grievingTry to understand that you and your loved one may be grieving in different ways. Be honestBeing honest with your children about ALS can be difficult, but age-appropriate honesty is necessary to maintain trust. Live in the presentFocus on living in the present without placing too much emphasis on what the future holds. Don\u2019t try to accomplish everything at onceTake things one day at a time and know that you do not have to accomplish everything at once. Focus on what you can doDon\u2019t dwell on what you can no longer do. A diagnosis of ALS does not mean your life is over. Focus on making positive memories with the person living with ALS. Intimacy is an important aspect of your well-being and is necessary for a healthy relationship. Sexual intimacy can be a significant part of a relationship and is a common issue for many people living with ALS and their partners. Lack of intimacy in your relationship can lead to emotional detachment from your partner. You may have to redefine what physical intimacy means in your relationship, but it does not have to come to an end. Causing injury Causing pain Managing uncomfortable positions during sex Breathing problems during sex Wearing their partner out Pressuring their partner into something they do not feel comfortable with The Motor Neurone Disease Association\u2019s sex and relationships bookletprovides ways to maintain physical contact with limited movement for people living with ALS (MND is another term for ALS).

Last Reviewed: June 21, 2022 The guide,Families and ALS: A guide for talking with and Supporting Children and Youths, provides detailed suggestions for conversations by age and developmental stage.  Start the conversation sooner rather than laterYou may never feel \u201cready\u201d to begin the conversation about ALS with your children. Although you should begin the conversation when you feel it is appropriate, psychologists recommend having the conversation sooner rather than later. Pick a time when you are doing something normal and calm, like relaxing at home, to put less pressure on both you and your children. If they don't want to talk, that is fine. Let them know they can come to you any time when they are ready. The key is to open the door for them. Be honestBeing honest with your children about ALS can be difficult, but age-appropriate honesty is necessary to maintain trust. This may include honestly sharing your own fears and concerns. Use age-appropriate languageUsing age-appropriate language will help your children better understand what is happening and what to expect in the future. Allow them to ask questions and be prepared to answer themYour children will likely have questions for you. It is important that you are prepared to answer them to the best of your ability. ALS is a complex disease, and some questions will be hard for you to answer because you may not know the answer yourself. If you do not know the answer to a question, let your children know, and don't hesitate to seek out support to get the answers you deserve. Keep the conversation openCheck in with your children often. As the disease progresses, children may not always feel comfortable asking questions. Make sure they know that they can talk to you about what is going on at home. Acknowledge their feelingsChildren experience complex feelings just like adults but often have a more difficult time regulating emotions. They may not react to the news in a way that you expect. Create a safe space for them to discuss their emotions by meeting them where they are and acknowledging their feelings. The following guides were developed by Dr. Kavanaugh to support parents and school professionals who have a child impacted by ALS. All guides are freely available atwww.globalneuroycare.org Real Kids Talk About ALS: Feeling Normal, Sad, and Different: graphic novel for youth, ages 7-12 The ALS experience: It\u2019s Different and Hard: A guide for middle school youth, ages 13-18 Families and ALS: A guide for talking with and Supporting Children and Youths School, Friends, Work, and ALS: A Young Adult Guide to Balancing Life with ALS At School: A guide to supporting Students who have been affected by ALS Care for ALS/MND often requires multiple caregivers, including children and youth. Yet, parents sometimes feel guilty when their children assist with caregiving. Children/youth are often involved in many areas of caregiving with ALS. They typically assist with tasks such as transferring, dressing, assisting with feeding and showering/toileting. Yet, children/youth generally receive inconsistent training, which impacts their confidence to provide care \u2014 and the quality of life for the care recipient.. With training and support, caregiving can be a source of pride for the children. Child/youth Caregiving Training and Support Developed and informed by clinical practice and research with families in ALS/MND, theYCareprogram provides hands-on training and support for children and youth caregivers. Led by ALS/MND health professionals, trained in the YCare model, the day-long activity-based YCare program provides children and youth the opportunity to: 1) meet health professionals, 2) ask questions about care, 3) learn and adapt care skills, and 4) meet and interact with \u201clike\u201d peers, who are also in families with ALS/MND. YCare is available across the U.S. and globally. For more information, contact Global Neuro YCare (www.globalneuroycare.org). Having your children help with caregiving is not inherently bad, but it is important for them to feel supported to prevent burnout, distrust and resentfulness. Attend family trainingsAllow your children to attend YCare and family trainings. Explain how to helpTake the time to explain how to complete tasks and why you need their help. Always use age-appropriate language and engage trained health professionals. Work together as a teamCaregiving is a team effort, and your children are part of your team! Working together as a team will help reduce stress for everyone. Support groups & campsChildren have a desire to connect with other individuals that are their age. Support groups can help your child connect with other children who are going through something similar and help them feel less isolated. Hope Loves Company is dedicated to providing emotional and educational support to children and young adults who have or had a loved one living with ALS. To learn more about their programs, visit:hopelovescompany.org. CounselingChildren are at a higher risk for psychosocial distress during this time. Counselors are trained professionals who can help your child talk through their feelings and manage emotional distress. Lead by exampleModel healthy coping behaviors such as making time for self-care. Leading by example does not mean you have to be perfect, but children are likely to mirror your responses to challenging situations. Engage in enjoyable activitiesIt is important for your children to take time for themselves and have fun. Encourage them to continue to participate in activities they enjoy such as participating in sports, playing video games or hanging out with friends. Collaborate with your child\u2019s schoolChildren may be afraid to talk with their teachers and peers about how ALS is impacting their life. It is important for families, teachers, and school counselors to communicate and ensure that children feel safe and supported at school.

        "content": "International Alliance of ALS/MND Associations Motor Neurone Disease(MND) is the name given to a group of diseases in which the nerve cells (neurones) that control muscles undergo degeneration and die.Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis(ALS),Progressive Muscular Atrophy(PMA),Progressive Bulbar Palsy(PBP) andPrimary Lateral Sclerosis(PLS) are all subtypes of motor neurone disease. MND is the widely used generic term in the United Kingdom, Australia and parts of Europe, and ALS is used more generically in the United States, Canada and South America. These diseases are also sometimes known asMaladie de Charcotand are often referred to in the United States asLou Gehrig\u2019s Disease, after the famous baseball player who died of the disease. By any name, ALS/MND is characterised by progressive degeneration of the motor nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. The motor cells (neurones) control the muscles that enable us to move around, speak, breathe, and swallow. With no nerves to activate them, muscles gradually weaken and waste. Symptoms may include muscle weakness and paralysis, as well as impaired speaking, swallowing, and breathing.\u00a0Progress is generally rapid, with an average life expectancy of between 2 and 5 years from the onset of symptoms. Though it can affect anyone, ALS/MND is more often found in the 40 to 70 year age group. The impact on the community of ALS/MND is usually measured by theincidenceandprevalenceof the disease.Incidenceis the number of new cases added in a defined period, usually a year.Prevalenceis the number of cases existing at any point in time. \u00a0The incidence of ALS/MND is 2 per 100,000 of total population, while the prevalence is around 6 per 100,000 of total population. Research has found that the incidence is higher in people aged over 50 years. A small proportion of cases\u00a0(~10%)\u00a0are familial (inherited) while the majority of cases\u00a0(~90%)\u00a0are still considered sporadic\u00a0or singleton.\u00a0However, research is continuing to\u00a0further\u00a0reveal genetic associations with ALS/MND. This will likely mean that many cases considered sporadic may also have a genetic contribution. Further research is needed to truly establish the extent of the genetic contribution to causing and/or moderating ALS/MND.\u00a0The Alliance believes that all people diagnosed with ALS/MND should have genetic counselling and testing if they chose to. Although classified as a rare disease based on its prevalence, ALS/MND in fact quite common. There are approximately 140,000 new cases diagnosed worldwide each year.\u00a0 That is 384 new cases every day! The disease affects each individual differently and can have a devastating impact on family, carers, and friends. The rapidly progressive nature of the disease requires constant adaptation to increasing and changing levels of disability, which in turn require increased levels of support.

Although Answer ALS enrollment is currently closed, the rich, multi-omics data resource continues to grow through our Neuromine data portal. We are actively adding new datasets from our partner ALS Research Collaborative (ARC) Study at the ALS Therapy Development Institute and from Champion Insights, a focused sub-study recruiting individuals with a higher incidence of ALS, including high-performance athletes, military personnel, and first responders. Together, these efforts ensure that scientists everywhere have access to an expanding, openly available foundation for discovery, driving progress toward treatments and a cure.To learn more about the ALS Therapy Development Institute\u2019s ARC Study:https://als.net/arc/To learn more about Champion Insights:https://championinsights.org/ In 2016, the Answer ALS team initiated the development of an innovative system designed to merge community data effectively and efficiently. This system integrates a wide range of information, including genomic data, clinical records, participant inputs, family medical histories, environmental data, and data from medical sensors like wearables. Researchers using the Answer ALS dataset apply advanced data analytics and machine learning to uncover patterns and insights. This approach allows for more sensitive, specific, and efficient analyses as data volumes grow. By collaborating with community partners, Answer ALS ensures that data collection, processing, and secure storage stay ahead of our analytical capabilities. To support transparency and accessibility, Answer ALS has made its data processing pipelines publicly available, including select workflows on the Galaxy platform. This platform supports both experienced bioinformaticians and experimental biologists, allowing them to execute computational analyses through a user-friendly graphical interface. Answer ALS is working to make its data processing pipelines more accessible by sharing them through platforms like GitHub and, where possible, Galaxy, an open source, web-based platform for data intensive biomedical research. The data managed and analyzed by Answer ALS will underpin new clinical trials and assist in creating subgroups for more targeted drug discovery. It will also facilitate the identification of drug-responsive biomarkers and diagnostics. By sharing these insights, techniques, and processes, Answer ALS fosters a collaborative research ecosystem. The insights derived will not only generate testable hypotheses and new conceptual frameworks but also illuminate disease mechanisms and support novel therapeutic approaches. We analyze the entire genome to understand the DNA sequences that underpin motor neuron function and disease progression. This foundational study helps us grasp the genetic basis of ALS. By studying RNA transcripts through RNA-Seq, we track how genetic instructions are turned into RNA, revealing the active genetic information in motor neurons that influences ALS. Using ATAC-Seq, we explore how gene expression is regulated by environmental and lifestyle factors through changes in the epigenome, identifying key regulatory elements that contribute to ALS. We employ SWATH-MS to study the full range of proteins produced by motor neurons, comparing protein expressions in ALS patients to those in healthy controls to identify disease-specific proteins. Through mass spectrometry, we analyze the metabolites in motor neurons to detect unique chemical fingerprints that differentiate ALS patients from healthy individuals, providing insights into the metabolic disruptions caused by ALS. Our use of automated robotic microscopy allows for the detailed tracking and analysis of live neurons, assessing changes over time to link cellular behavior with ALS progression. This dynamic imaging helps build predictive models of disease development and potential therapeutic responses. By integrating data from genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and robotic imaging, Answer ALS offers a comprehensive view of ALS pathology. This approach deepens our understanding of the disease mechanisms and aids in identifying new targets for treatment, advancing towards personalized medicine strategies for ALS. The Answer ALS Research Project has created nearly 1,000 unique stem cell lines from ALS patients and over 100 healthy controls. By transforming these iPSCs into brain and spinal cord cells, the project models ALS on a broad scale, facilitating a deeper understanding of the disease\u2019s mechanisms across its various forms. This extensive data collection serves as one of the most comprehensive repositories of chemical, clinical, genetic, and biological data in the history of ALS research. It forms the basis for defining patient subgroups, understanding disease pathways, and identifying potential new treatments and biomarkers. Sample Collection and Processing:Blood samples from participants were anonymized and sent to Dr. Clive Svendsen\u2019s laboratory at Cedars-Sinai. Here, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) have been reprogrammed into iPSCs. Neuronal Differentiation:These iPSCs have been differentiated into motor neurons\u2014the cell type primarily affected in ALS. This transformation is optimized to increase efficiency and yield, enabling the production of motor neurons at a rate suitable for large-scale analysis. Scaling and Optimization:Traditionally, generating multiple iPSC and motor neuron lines is standard for laboratories. However, the Svendsen Lab has adapted to process dozens of samples simultaneously, significantly scaling up operations to meet the demands of the Answer ALS project. This work advances our understanding of ALS and supports ongoing big data and omics studies. Researchers interested in accessing these iPSC lines can find more information and order through Cedars-Sinai\u2019s dedicated biomanufacturing page: Cedars-Sinai iPSC. Induced pluripotent stem cells, developed from adult blood cells, can differentiate into any cell type in the body. This technology, pioneered by Shinya Yamanaka in 2006, involves reprogramming adult cells by introducing specific transcription factors. iPSCs are invaluable for studying ALS as they allow for endless propagation and provide a personalized model to investigate the variability in disease progression among patients.

        "content": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, is a fatal neurological disorder that attacks nerve cells responsible for controlling voluntary muscles such as those in the arms, legs, and face. It is the most common form of motor neuron disease, characterized by the gradual degeneration and death of these neurons. As the motor neurons deteriorate, muscles receive fewer signals from the brain, weakening and leading to atrophy and fasciculations (subtle twitches). Eventually, ALS patients lose the ability to initiate and control voluntary movements. Most critically, when respiratory muscles fail, individuals require ventilatory support, and the majority succumb to respiratory failure within three to five years from the onset of symptoms. Notably, around 10% of patients may survive more than ten years. Despite primarily affecting motor functions, ALS does not usually impact cognitive abilities. However, some patients might experience changes in cognitive functions such as decision-making and memory, and emotional health can be affected, with instances of depression. Counseling and medication may offer necessary support. Typically, ALS spares the muscles controlling eye movement, as well as sensory functions like sight, smell, taste, hearing, and touch. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rare yet devastating neurodegenerative disease. In the United States, there are currently about 33,000 people living with ALS (prevalence). That number is expected to rise to over 36,000 or more by 2030, largely due to demographic shifts and an aging population. Annually, approximately 2.2 new cases per 100,000 people are diagnosed in the U.S., a rate that is broadly similar in many European countries. Globally, incidence estimates range from 1.9 to 6 per 100,000 people, depending on the region, with prevalence in most parts of the world typically between 4 and 10 per 100,000. However, some countries report lower or higher values. These statistics underscore both the rarity of ALS and the urgent need for continued research to improve diagnosis, treatment, and prevention worldwide. ALS begins subtly, with initial symptoms including muscle cramps, stiffness, weakness in an arm or leg, and difficulty with speech and swallowing. As the disease progresses, these symptoms extend to more severe muscle atrophy, affecting manual dexterity and mobility. Symptoms such as difficulty swallowing and speaking increase with disease progression, and eventually, individuals lose the ability to perform daily activities independently. Over time, ALS patients may require assistance with eating due to the risk of choking and will experience significant weight loss. Although mental faculties generally remain intact, some individuals develop cognitive impairments or dementia. Health care professionals play a crucial role in outlining the disease trajectory and discussing treatment options to help patients make informed decisions. In advanced stages, patients depend on ventilatory support as respiratory muscles weaken, increasing their risk of complications like pneumonia.

        "content": "Neurologist and professor at Johns Hopkins University and director of the Brain Science Institute, ALS clinic and Robert Packard Center for ALS Research addresses common myths surrounding an ALS diagnosis. While Lyme disease and ALS can sometimes share neurological symptoms, they are very different conditions. Lyme disease is treatable with antibiotics, whereas ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with no known cure today. Research has not found evidence that Lyme disease causes ALS, but sometimes Lyme can be misdiagnosed as ALS because of overlapping symptoms. ALS is often thought of as a disease of older adults, but that\u2019s a misconception. While the average age of diagnosis is between 55 and 65, ALS can strike at nearly any age and even in people in their 20s, 30s, or 40s. Many well-known cases, like athletes and veterans, were diagnosed at a much younger age than people expect. For decades, ALS research was defined by frustration: only two FDA-approved drugs exist, and their impact is modest. Clinical trials piled up, most ending in failure\u2014not because ALS can\u2019t be treated, but because we didn\u2019t yet understand enough about the disease. That\u2019s changing. Today, ALS research is accelerating at a pace we\u2019ve never seen before. Investments from industry and pharma are growing rapidly, powered by cutting-edge tools like AI and stem cell\u2013derived patient models. Openly shared datasets, like those in Answer ALS, are fueling discovery across the globe. Each breakthrough builds on the last, creating momentum that\u2019s reshaping how we approach both drug development and clinical trials. While NIH and nonprofits remain crucial funders, it\u2019s this combination\u2014AI, open data, and bold industry engagement\u2014that is pushing us toward real treatments. For the first time, we have both the science and the infrastructure to unravel ALS in ways that simply weren\u2019t possible even five years ago.

        "content": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (a-my-o-TROE-fik LAT-ur-ul skluh-ROE-sis), known as ALS, is a nervous system disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.ALScauses loss of muscle control. The disease gets worse over time. ALSis often called Lou Gehrig's disease after the baseball player who was diagnosed with it. The exact cause of the disease is still not known. A small number of cases are inherited. ALSoften begins with muscle twitching and weakness in an arm or leg, trouble swallowing or slurred speech. EventuallyALSaffects control of the muscles needed to move, speak, eat and breathe. There is no cure for this fatal disease. Symptoms ofALSvary from person to person. Symptoms depend on which nerve cells are affected.ALSgenerally begins with muscle weakness that spreads and gets worse over time. Symptoms might include: ALSoften starts in the hands, feet, arms or legs. Then it spreads to other parts of the body. Muscles get weaker as more nerve cells die. This eventually affects chewing, swallowing, speaking and breathing. There's generally no pain in the early stages ofALS. Pain also is not common in the later stages.ALSdoesn't usually affect bladder control. It also usually doesn't affect the senses, including the ability to taste, smell, touch and hear.

Please, try again in a couple of minutes ALSaffects the nerve cells that control voluntary muscle movements such as walking and talking. These nerve cells are called motor neurons. There are two groups of motor neurons. The first group extends from the brain to the spinal cord to muscles throughout the body. They're referred to as upper motor neurons. The second group extends from the spinal cord to muscles throughout the body. They're referred to as lower motor neurons. ALScauses both groups of motor neurons to gradually deteriorate and then die. When motor neurons are damaged, they stop sending messages to the muscles. As a result, the muscles can't function. For about 10% of people withALS, a genetic cause can be identified. For the rest, the cause is not known. Researchers continue to study possible causes ofALS. Most theories center on a complex interaction between genes and factors in the environment. Established risk factors forALSinclude: Environmental factors, such as the following, have been associated with an increased risk ofALS. As the disease progresses,ALScauses complications, such as: Over time,ALSleads to weakness of the muscles used to breathe. People withALSmight need a device such as a mask ventilator to help them breathe at night. The device is similar to what someone with sleep apnea might wear. This type of device supports the person's breathing through a mask worn over the nose, the mouth or both. Some people with advancedALSchoose to have a tracheostomy. This is a surgically created hole at the front of the neck leading to the windpipe. A ventilator may work better on a tracheostomy than on a mask. The most common cause of death for people withALSis breathing failure. Half of people withALSdie within 14 to 18 months of diagnosis. However, some people withALSlive 10 years or longer. Most people withALSdevelop weakness of the muscles used to form speech. This usually starts with slower speech and occasional slurring of words. It then becomes harder to speak clearly. This can progress to the point that others can't understand the person's speech. Other forms of communication and technology are used to communicate. People withALScan develop weakness of the muscles involved with swallowing. This can lead to malnutrition and dehydration. They are also at higher risk of getting food, liquids or saliva into the lungs, which can cause pneumonia. A feeding tube can reduce these risks and ensure proper hydration and nutrition. Some people withALShave problems with language and decision-making. Some are eventually diagnosed with a form of dementia called frontotemporal dementia.
